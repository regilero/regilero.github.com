          <p>In this article we'll study how to tune the <code>php.ini</code> settings for a Drupal host,
how to manage variations of theses settings <strong>per Virtalhosts</strong>,
and of course how to do it without the ugly <code>.htaccess</code> file.</p>

<h2>Get a Drupal VirtualHost</h2>

<p>Why am I saying <code>.htaccess</code> files are ugly and you should have a VirtualHost for your Drupal?<br/>
Because <code>.htaccess</code> files are slowing down your Apache, and everything set by Drupal in
the .htaccess can be safely put in the VirtualHost. <br/>
Check <a href="/Drupal/English/2011/09/01/better_rewrite_rules_for_drupal/">this previous article</a> for details
(first part is about removing the .htaccess).</p>

<p>Now having a VirtualHost you can handle several parallel Drupal installations on the same host
and you will be able to securize this by adding restrictions on the available directories
for each separate VirtualHost.<br/>
We will see that we will also be able to handle <strong>different PHP configurations</strong> for each VirtualHost.</p>

<h2>Several configurations? But I only have one php.ini!</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Only one php.ini is loaded by PHP, but you can alter the PHP settings in apache configuration
by using <code>php_value</code>, <code>php_admin_value</code>, <code>php_flag</code> and <code>php_admin_flag</code> directives.<br/>
You could also alter the PHP settings in PHP code with <code>ini_set()</code> instructions.
But the <code>php_admin_value</code> and php_admin<em><em>flag differs from the simpliest one by the fact any
setting set with the **"</em>admin</em>"<strong> commands </strong>cannot be overriden** by any <code>ini_set()</code> call in the code.</p>

<p>So this means you will be able to set the PHP settings to the value you need for each VirtualHost,
just think about the <code>open_basedir</code> restriction, each Drupal installation can have an <code>open_basedir</code>
that forbids any access to another parallel Drupal website on the same host.</p>

<h2>What are the PHP settings enforced by default Drupal .htaccess?</h2>

<p>First let's see what is the default php settings that Drupal is asking for in Drupal6:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="nt">&lt;ifmodule</span> <span class="s">mod_php5.c=&quot;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
   <span class="nb">php_value</span> magic_quotes_gpc                <span class="m">0</span>
   <span class="nb">php_value</span> register_globals                <span class="m">0</span>
   <span class="nb">php_value</span> session.auto_start              <span class="m">0</span>
   <span class="nb">php_value</span> mbstring.http_input             pass
   <span class="nb">php_value</span> mbstring.http_output            pass
   <span class="nb">php_value</span> mbstring.encoding_translation   <span class="m">0</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/ifmodule&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>And in Drupal7:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="nt">&lt;ifmodule</span> <span class="s">mod_php5.c=&quot;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
   <span class="nb">php_flag</span> magic_quotes_gpc                 <span class="k">off</span>
   <span class="nb">php_flag</span> magic_quotes_sybase              <span class="k">off</span>
   <span class="nb">php_flag</span> register_globals                 <span class="k">off</span>
   <span class="nb">php_flag</span> session.auto_start               <span class="k">off</span>
   <span class="nb">php_value</span> mbstring.http_input             pass
   <span class="nb">php_value</span> mbstring.http_output            pass
   <span class="nb">php_flag</span> mbstring.encoding_translation    <span class="k">off</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/ifmodule&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Not much differences. <br/>
The <code>0</code> becames <code>off</code>, that mean the same, except if you use php <code>ini_get()</code> functions in your scripts
(<a href="http://www.makina-corpus.org/blog/how-retrieve-boolean-values-php-s-configuration">see here how bad is ini_get()</a>).</p>

<p>Drupal7 adds the <code>magic_quotes_sybase</code> de-activation, which is a good rule that you can backport to Drupal6,
as if this setting is on, then magic quoting will happen.<br/>
Magic quotes are bad, http input stream is not the right place to escape strings for <code>SQL</code>,
you need to do it before any SQL input, but this is the only right place
(so quite dep in the code, and magic quoting does not protect you as much as database provided escape functions),
else you will even be magic-quoting the uploaded files...</p>

<p><code>register_globals</code> is <code>off</code>, very dangerous setting when it's On.<br/>
For mbstrings settings I'll trust Drupal when they say they want it this way.</p>

<p>But that's a quite short php tuning.</p>

<h2>Where to put the files?</h2>

<p>So we said we wanted several Drupal, running in parallel projects
(We're not talking about Drupal multi-site handling, which is another problem,
we're talking about Drupal projects). And we wanted to protect each one from the others.<br/>
The things to secure are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>temporary files</strong> (by default everyone share the same path in <code>/tmp</code>, not very clean, the less secure application you run with this apache will give you the security level of this <code>/tmp</code></li>
<li><strong>uploaded files</strong> while they're uploaded</li>
<li><strong>filesystem</strong> access, by default any PHP application as the power to read any file the web user can see</li>
</ul>


<p>But in term of projects we would certainly also like to have configuration files,
administrative scripts, and documentations, maybe logs as well.</p>

<p>The project tree can be a quite long debate, so I'll give you one as an example,
then the settings in this article will use this tree, but you can alter it I wont cry.
So for a project named <strong>mydrupal</strong> accessed via <strong>http://mydrupal.example.com</strong>
(use your <code>/etc/hosts</code> to map it to <code>127.0.0.1</code> in dev):</p>

<pre>
 -/
  \-var/
    \-www/
      \-mydrupal/
         # project root
        \-etc/
          # here goes the configuration files, like for example you Apache Virtualhost
          # linked in /etc/apache2/sites-available/42-mydrupal.example.com (debian)
        \-www/
          # here goes Drupal sources, this is the Web Directory Root (DocumentRoot)
           \-sites
             \-default
               # here is Drupal settings.php
                \-files
             \-all
                \-files
        \-bin/
          # here goes your managment scripts
        \-doc/
          # project documentation
        \-var/
          \-log/
            # apache logs for this project.
            # Directory may be linked to /var/log/apache2/mydrupal.example.com
            # for log rotation, or use cronolog
          \-tmp/
            # this is the temporary directory for that project
</pre>


<p>You may need to write some scripts to maintain ownership and rights on this tree. Hee are some hints:</p>

<ul>
<li>the web user (www-data) needs read access on all files on the <code>/var/www/mydrupal/www</code> subtree</li>
<li>the web user needs the "x" right on each parent directory (<code>/var/www/mydrupal</code>, <code>/var/www/</code>, <code>/var</code>)</li>
<li>default rights for directories should be "2775" with ownserhip or group to the web user</li>
<li>default rights for files should be "0664" with ownserhip or group to the web user</li>
<li>on some directories the web user needs <strong>write access</strong>, the files subdirectories under <code>"/var/www/mydrupal/www/sites/[all|default|foo]"</code></li>
<li>for a <em>tmp</em> directory you can use <code>"chmod 1777"</code>, the <strong>1</strong> is important, else use <code>"chmod 2775"</code> with <code>"www-data:www-data"</code> ownership.</li>
</ul>


<p>Usually chmod command use 3 digits, when using 4 the first one as some meanings,
the "2" for directories means that new files and directories created there will inherit the user and group
of the directory, this is really important for the <code>"files/"</code> subdirectory where Drupal is sometimes
creating new subdirectories.</p>

<p>To use a different temporary directory than <code>/tmp</code> we'll have to alter the Drupal configuration and some of
the PHP settings. For Drupal settings you simply need to add this line in the settings.php file:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="php"><span class="x"># Drupal 6</span>
<span class="x">$conf[&#39;file_directory_temp&#39;] = &#39;/var/www/mydrupal/var/tmp&#39;;</span>
<span class="x"># Drupal 7</span>
<span class="x">$conf[&#39;file_temporary_path&#39;] = &#39;/var/www/mydrupal/var/tmp&#39;;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h2>Let's add some PHP settings</h2>

<p>So we keep the existing settings (take the Drupal7 version). And now we add some more.</p>

<h4>Upload</h4>

<p>First we'll put some default settings for File upload management:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="nb">php_admin_flag</span>  file_uploads            <span class="m">1</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> upload_tmp_dir          <span class="s2">&quot;/var/www/mydrupal/var/tmp&quot;</span>
<span class="c">#Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> upload_max_filesize     <span class="s2">&quot;50M&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> max_input_time          <span class="m">120</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> post_max_size           <span class="s2">&quot;50M&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>We are using our new temporary directory,
limit the size of any POST request to 50M,
same for the uploaded files,
and allow 2 minutes for the client to push these 50M before disconnecting.</p>

<h4>Logs</h4>

<p>Now let's handle PHP logs, first if we are not in development mode,
we'll prevent Drupal from allowing messages to be outputed.
If you grep <code>display_errors</code> in Drupal source code you'll see that the administrator
can allow error output on the page, very dangerous in production, with an <code>"admin_value"</code>
here it won't be allowed.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> display_errors          <span class="m">0</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> display_startup_errors  <span class="m">0</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> html_errors             <span class="m">0</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> log_errors              <span class="m">1</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> define_syslog_variables <span class="m">0</span>
<span class="c">#E_ALL &amp; ~E_NOTICE -&gt; 6135</span>
<span class="c">#E_ALL -&gt; 6143</span>
<span class="c">#E_ALL^E_STRICT -&gt; 8191</span>
<span class="c"># really all -&gt; -1</span>
<span class="nb">php_value</span> error_reporting               <span class="m">6135</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>You cannot use <code>E_ALL</code> notation, we're not in PHP execution environment and the PHP defines
are not defined, so we need to use the numerical value of theses options</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>Here are the most important settings, first I'll list them:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> open_basedir    <span class="s2">&quot;.:/var/www/mydrupal/www:/var/www/mydrupal/var/tmp:/usr/share/php/:/usr/share/php5/&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">php_value</span>       include_path    <span class="s2">&quot;.:/usr/lib/php5/20090626+lfs:/var/www/mydrupal/www:/var/www/mydrupal/www/include:/usr/share/php/:/usr/share/php5/&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> expose_php      <span class="m">0</span>
<span class="c"># you may need to allow url_fopen, but by default we dissallow it</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> allow_url_fopen <span class="m">0</span>
<span class="c"># Do not show detailled headers with apache, apache modules, and php version</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> expose_php      <span class="m">0</span>
<span class="c"># safe_mode is more buggy than no safe mode</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> safe_mode       <span class="m">0</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Now, let's explain them from the end to the top.</p>

<p><strong>"safe_mode"</strong> is not activated, using the PHP safe_mode is in fact not a "safe" thing and as proven more security problems
than not using it, it will soon be a deprecated option (well, it is deprecated in PHP 5.3).</p>

<p><strong>"expose_php"</strong> is a not-known-enough PHP setting that set a default header in the HTTP answer if you
do not disable it. In my Apache Virtualhost I've been reading the security file,
and I've set the <code>"ServerToken Prod"</code> setting to avoid disclaiming Apache version in the HTTP headers,
cool, it's only saying "Apache" and not "Apache.2.2 (debian ...).<br/>
Now if I do not set this expose_php php settings PHP will add this awfull header:</p>

<pre>
    X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.10-2ubuntu6.10
</pre>


<p>Funny thing the official documentation say you can only alter it in php.ini, well it works in a VirtualHost</p>

<p><strong>"allow_url_fopen"</strong>, you may need to allow this if you need to perform includes to some other websites.<br/>
By default I prefer disallowing this setting, as it's the starting point of a lot of security attacks
(bad filtered includes for example).<br/>
When developpers really needs it, they need to buy some beers if they want this setting altered.</p>

<p><strong>`"include_path"</strong> this is not complelty related to security (but ùaitain it close to open_basedir, easier to maintain).
It's the path where PHP will search when you gives it a filename to include which is not <strong>absolute</strong>.<br/>
You should keep this list quite short. So having your project path here, and not the others,
is quite important, do not forget the dot, it means the <strong>"current directory"</strong>.<br/>
And if you use PHP extensions (like, maybe, apc) you may need to help includes in the places
where these common extensions are shared.</p>

<p><strong>"open_basedir"</strong> this is <strong>the most important setting</strong>. And maybe the one giving you some errors after activation.
PHP will not be able to work in a directory which is not listed there.<br/>
So you'll need your project web directory (the <code>www</code> inside the project) but also the temporary directory
(not <code>/tmp</code> for us) and the shared libraries directories. <br/>
The important thing is to prevent inclusion of your OS's <code>/etc</code> and of other projects files (like with <code>/tmp</code>)</p>

<h4>Some other useful things</h4>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="c"># Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data</span>
<span class="nb">php_value</span> max_execution_time            <span class="s2">&quot;300&quot;</span>
<span class="c"># Maximum amount of memory a script may consume</span>
<span class="nb">php_value</span> memory_limit                  <span class="s2">&quot;32M&quot;</span>
 
<span class="c"># Sessions: IMPORTANT reactivate garbage collector on Debian!!!</span>
<span class="nb">php_value</span> session.gc_maxlifetime        <span class="m">3600</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> session.gc_probability  <span class="m">1</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> session.gc_divisor      <span class="m">100</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>So here after 300s (4minutes) a PHP script will be killed.<br/>
Then we limit the memory usage of any Apache process running this website to 32M.<br/>
Some bad Drupal developpers will cry and ask for 128M, but, hey, who can buy 13Go of RAM just to handle
100 parallel HTTP requests?.<br/>
You may need to alter that for Drupal, which is an heavy RAM-eater. But you may also read my next article
about php-fpm (and ask Makina-Coprus for an audit, why the hell your Drupal needs 128M?)</p>

<p>Notice that we've used <strong>"php_value"</strong> and not <strong>"php_admin_value"</strong> for some of these settings,
it means that for a given Drupal method, for a given HTTP request, deep in the code, you may use <strong>ini_set()</strong>
functions to alter theses settings (like asking for 128M of RAM for one request or allowing for more time).</p>

<p>Last point as a comment which says all, on Debian the PHP garbage collector is inactivated
(to use a debian script cleaning the <code>/var/lib/php5</code> session directory).<br/>
Problem, Drupal is not using PHP default session management, and needs the garbage collector
call to perform session cleanups. If you forgot that, you may get a session table in Drupal
growing until your <code>/var/lib/mysql</code> partition gets full (and this may let you in a quite bad
situation -- hopefully the drupal server will maybe start to be quite slow when requesting
the millions of rows session table and you will see it before)</p>

<h3>Apc and Memcache settings?</h3>

<p>Want some more? Here are some settings for classical APC or memchache usage (via php-memcache, not php-memcached).</p>

<p>For APC some settings musn't be altered on each VirtualHost,
they're shared, so they should be global to the Apache server. <br/>
Alter theses settings in the real php.ini or /etc/php5/conf.d/apc.ini file:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="c"># Shared Memory</span>
<span class="c"># These settings MUS&#39;NT be ALTERED ON A PER-VIRTUALHOST basis</span>
<span class="c"># BUT THEY&#39;RE IMPORTANT, by default you&#39;ll get only 30M for the whole</span>
<span class="c"># opcode+user cache, very short, very dangerous (apc emptying cache when full)</span>
<span class="c"># SO YOU MUST ALTER DEFAULT APC CONFIGURATION on SHARED MEMORY</span>
<span class="err">apc</span>.<span class="err">shm_segments=1</span>
<span class="err">apc</span>.<span class="err">shm_size=128</span>
<span class="err">apc</span>.<span class="err">mmap_file_mask=/apc</span>.<span class="err">shm</span>.<span class="nb">XXXXXX</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Here we ask for 128M of shared memory.<br/>
The default is 30M because most OS will not allow you to ask for 128M or 256M.<br/>
To allow 128M Put in <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> at least theses numbers (and load them in sysctl):</p>

<pre>
kernel.shmmax=134217728
kernel.shmall=2097152
</pre>


<p>Now for the Virtualhost here are some settings:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="apache"><span class="nb">php_admin_flag</span>  apc.enabled                     <span class="m">1</span> 
<span class="c"># file upload progress bar available</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> apc.rfc1867                     <span class="m">1</span>
 
<span class="c"># ON a VirtualHost basis we can tune theses APC settings</span>
<span class="c"># want to gain speed? ------------------</span>
<span class="c"># Optimisation of include/require_once calls</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_value</span> apc.include_once_override       <span class="m">1</span>
<span class="c"># transform paths in absolute ones (no effect if apc.stat is not 0), files from stream wrappers (extended includes)</span>
<span class="c"># won&#39;t be cached if this is activated as they cannot be used with php&#39;s realpath()</span>
<span class="nb">php_admin_flag</span>  apc.canonicalize                <span class="m">1</span>

<p>As stated in the comments, in production you should set the apc.stat &amp; apc.stat_ctime flags to 1.
It will be a lot faster, but APC will not even try to see if the file has been updated on disk.</p>

<p>And for memcache here are some default settings that you could use:</p>
