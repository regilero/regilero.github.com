excerpt: Step by step Apache+php-fpm installation of Drupal with some explanations on how to use php-fpm chroot while still not having mod_proxy_fcgi.

---

Using PHP-fpm is a way to push PHP execution outside of Apache,
one of the main reasons to use it is freeing memory usage of PHP in the apache processes
and allowing usage of a threaded Apache server.

In this article we'll explain what this sentence means :-) and will detail installation
and configuration of php-fpm for a Drupal project.  
We'll try to keep all the good php settings for project separation we used [before]({% post_url 2011-09-02-Tune_your_php_settings_for_drupal %}),
and we'll try to provide a solution to the chrooted php-fpm problems.

##Why do we need php-fpm to solve Apache memory problems with Drupal?##

Well, first you are maybe not needing it.  
But if you experience problems with the memory usage of Drupal
(usually big functionnal websites ask for more than 64M in PHP memory_limit)
and the number of parallel requests handled by apache, then you'll may find
a good solution with php-fpm.

###Apache processes, PHP Memory, Prefork and Worker MPM###

On a basic apache/PHP installation you're quite certainly using PHP as `mod_php`,
it means it's an **Apache module**. And when `memory_limit` is set to `64M`
it means **each** Apache child process can grow up to 64M.
With `mod_php` Apache is enforced in the **prefork** model,
so **each HTTP request use one Apache fork**, with `MaxClient` limit (usually **150** by default).
By default you handle 150 parallel HTTP request.  
But there's also the `KeepAlive` settings, by default **15s** (but please set that to **3s**),
so a forked Apache process stay online with the client browser for that amount of time,
and cannot handle a new request.   
If you use long keepalives, and even with shorts ones, chances are you'll soon need more than
150 in MaxClients to handle parallel incoming HTTP requests.
And here comes the **64M** of RAM per apache process.
If you want to push the MaxClients to 250 : `250 * 64M = 15,6 Go` of RAM!

The **prefork mpm** is the very **old** way to handle incoming requests for Apache.
One of the cool things coming with Apache 2 was the **worker mpm**.
In this mode Apache forks a *few* process (let's say 10 for example) and use threads inside
(from 25 to 75 by default), handling here `10*75 = 750` HTTP requests in parallel.  
It would be quite cool to use that on big websites,
for example all static files (js, css, images, ...) could be handled by parallel Apache threads,
maybe disabling KeepAlive completly, one request, one thread, simple and fast
(well, tests different combinations, it depends).  
But **mod_php cannot be used in the worker mpm**.  
PHP 5 is multithread-enabled, but this is not the case for all PHP libraries.
Check documentation warnings on `setlocale()`, here if you have several languages in your websites,
you may have mixed languages in the output if parallel threads in Apache are calling different `selocale()`, quite bad.
And you could encounter this with a lot of PHP extension, hard to find, hard to debug,
this is why mod_php is always used with the old prefork model.

##PHP as fastcgi##

So we're not using all capabilities of Apache because of PHP? That's sad.  
But if you extract PHP from Apache and run it in his own daemon then Apache is simply acting as a proxy of your PHP content generation.  
This is one of the main ideas in `%cgi%` things.
PHP is not only available as mod_php (apache module), it can be used in cli (command line interface), so it can be used as cgi.

Strictly speaking cgi is a slow thing, this is why **fastcgi** exists, and in the fastcgi familly there's quite a lot of possibilities
(fastcgi fcgid, etc). I'm too lazy to explain them all.

The important thing is that **php-fpm** is a way to **run php as a fastcgi**.  
When Apache 2.2.4 will be there (or if you are brave enough to use Apache unstable 2.2.3),
the right way to connect Apache and php-fpm will be the Apache module [mod_proxy_fcgi](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/fr/mod/mod_proxy_fcgi.html).
The name says all, Apache is simply proxying a fastcgi thing outside, which produces results for each given HTTP request.  
Waiting for that we'll instead use the apache module mod_fcgi.  
It works quite well, but the behaviour is not as simple and clear as the proxy behavior.
Some Apache environment variables are still transfered to this module,
and we'll see that using php-fpm in a chrooted environment for each project will be a little more complex
than what it would be with the future **mod_proxy_fastcgi**, anyway I'll explain a solution so we can now start the install.

##Installing php-fpm on Debian step by step##

This step by step was tested on a Debian squeeze (6.0).  
You'd better start it on a fresh install.
Installing php-fpm on a server where mod_php with Apache in mpm_prefork is still needed is not possible.

###Adding dotdeb & non-free repositories###

We'll need the dotdeb repository

Add this line in /etc/apt/sources.list

{% highlight bash %}
    deb http://packages.dotdeb.org stable all
{% endhighlight %}

then add the GnuPG key

{% highlight bash %}
    wget http://www.dotdeb.org/dotdeb.gpg
    cat dotdeb.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    rm dotdeb.gpg
{% endhighlight %}

Apache mod_fcgi is needed to link php-fpm (and not apache-fcgid) so add the non-free repository

{% highlight bash %}
  # need non-free packages for FCGI (not FCGID)
  deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ squeeze contrib non-free
  deb-src http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ squeeze contrib non-free
{% endhighlight %}
  
Then add contrib and non-free tags to the squeeze-update line to get:

{% highlight bash %}
  # squeeze-updates, previously known as 'volatile'
  deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ squeeze-updates main contrib non-free
  deb-src http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ squeeze-updates main contrib non-free
{% endhighlight %}

And now that we set all the sources reload the sources informations

{% highlight bash %}
  apt-get update
{% endhighlight %}

###Adding packages###

For PHP we'll need some packages, do that before installing apache packages, simplier

{% highlight bash %}
  apt-get install php5 php5-fpm php-pear php5-common php5-mcrypt \
    php5-mysql php5-cli php5-gd php5-curl php5-apc
{% endhighlight %}

And now enforce Apache with the worker mode (using php-fpm with apache in prefork is useless)

{% highlight bash %}
  apt-get install apache2-mpm-worker libapache2-mod-fastcgi
{% endhighlight %}

###Apache modules configuration###

We activate the apache modules fascgi and actions

{% highlight bash %}
    a2enmod fastcgi actions
{% endhighlight %}

We add some more useful modules, headers, expires, status and rewrite

{% highlight bash %}
   a2enmod expires headers status rewrite
{% endhighlight %}

And while we are working with apache modules let's removed some useles ones (this will reduce the memory footprint of Apache).
But check that in your own installation you do not need them. 
 
 * **autoindex** is this awfull thing listing your directory contents when you forget to protect a directory, 
 * **cgid** is a pure cgi module (still running Ã  perl cgi app from 1995?) 
 * and **negotiation** allows some languages negociation in the HTTP protocol between the browser and the server -- you may need it, I don't--
it could also choose to use a file with same name as the request but not the right extension, strange behavoirs incoming!

{% highlight bash %}
    a2dismod autoindex cgid negotiation
{% endhighlight %}

We add cronolog to avoid apache slowing because of log tasks. But this is not something required for php-fpm :-)

{% highlight bash %}
apt-get install cronolog
{% endhighlight %}
 

Usage of cronolog in your apache configuration is quite simple, instead of writing this:

{% highlight apache %}
ErrorLog /var/www/myproject/var/log/error-myproject.log
CustomLog /var/www/myproject/var/log/access-myproject.log combined
{% endhighlight %}

You will use that:

{% highlight apache %}
ErrorLog "|nice -n 10 /usr/bin/cronolog /var/www/myproject/var/log/%Y/%W/%d-myproject-error.log
CustomLog "|nice -n 10 /usr/bin/cronolog /var/www/myproject/var/log/%Y/%W/%d-myproject-access.log" combined
{% endhighlight %}

###Project Tree###

We'll use the project tree defined in a [previous article]({% post_url 2011-09-02-Tune_your_php_settings_for_drupal %}).
This article was about tunning the PHP configuration, but is also managing project trees,
so that having several Drupal projects running on the same host you encapsulate nicely each project in his own environment.  
We will still try to encapsultate each php-fpm Drupal project **in a separate environment** so everything stated there should
still apply in our new way of working.

In this tree everything was in `/var/www/nameoftheproject`, I'll add a company prefix, so the base of the tree for my projects
are `/var/www/makina/nameoftheproject`. Inside I have a `www/` directory (`documentRoot`),
an `etc/` directory for configuration files, a `var/` directory for logs and temporary files, etc.

###Minimal fastcgi.conf###

The first thing to edit is the `fastcgi.conf` file in `/etc/apache2/mods-available/fastcgi.conf`

{% highlight apache %}
<ifmodule mod_fastcgi.c="">
         FastCgiIpcDir /var/www/makina/mydrupal/var/fcgi/
</ifmodule>
{% endhighlight %}

Which may be smaller than thee default one you may have. Most of these things will be set in the VirtualHost configuration instead.

As you can see we need a `var/fcgi` directory in our project tree.  
It will be used to store the **socket** making the connection between apache and php-fpm.

{% highlight bash %}
    mkdir -p /var/www/makina/mydrupal/var/fcgi/
{% endhighlight %}
    
We will leave the Apache configuration for a while and start the configuration of **php-fpm**,
we'll get back on Apache with the VirtualHost, later.

##FPM configuration##

###Main php-fpm configuration###

Backup conf example

{% highlight bash %}
    mv /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf.orig
    cp /etc/php5/fpm/php-fpm.conf /etc/php5/fpm/php-fpm.conf.bak
{% endhighlight %}

Now edit the main php-fpm configuration file `/etc/php5/fpm/php-fpm.conf` and alter it to get this content
(the most important thing is to really get the include of the **pool.d directory** at the end, and only files ending in `.conf`):

{% highlight php %}

; To configure the pools it is recommended to have one .conf file per
; pool in the following directory:
include=/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/*.conf
{% endhighlight %}

###php-fpm Pool configuration###

The **pool** is your project.  
php-fpm can run several pools, we'll use one for each separate project.  
So for a project named *mydrupal* we'll use a file `/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/mydrupal.conf`.

you can read the `/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf.orig` file to see what a default pool can contain.
The most important parameters are **prefix** and **chroot**.  
A complete pool configuration is given a few lines below. But before reading it we'll need to understand the **chroot problem**.

###Chrooted php-fpm###

As said before **mod_proxy_fcgi** will soon be the right way to connect Apache and php-fpm, especially if you want chrooted php-fpm instances.

In **mod_fastcgi** we cannot alter `DOCUMENT_ROOT` and `SCRIPT_FILENAME` environment variables,
and these variables contain the **non-chrooted informations**.  
I made a lot of tests with **mod_rewrite**, php **auto_prepend_file**, etc, no way to fix that.  
While waiting for that solution the only *'solution'* is to **rebuild the real path** in the php-fpm's pool chroot
and **link the www directory to the real one**.

Without the chroot things are quite simple, you can try it before if you want.  
With the chroot options in php-fpm we enforce the php-fpm execution in `/var/www/makina/mydrupal` (the pool prefix).  
No way to get to a parent directory. Fine for parallel projects security.  
But php-fpm receive a `DocumentRoot` from apache, telling it should move (cd) into `var/www/makina/mydrupal/www`.  
Well we're already quite there, we would like just a move to `www/`, but for php-fpm this means it needs to go to 
`/var/www/makina/mydrupal/var/www/makina/mydrupal/www`... And no way to alter this document root and script filename received instructions.

So in our working project `/var/www/makina/mydrupal` where php files are in `www/` we do **a symbolic link** of this too long path 
to the short one we would like to have:

{% highlight bash %}
    export $pool=mydrupal
    cd /var/www/makina/$pool
    mkdir -p var/www/makina/$pool
    # warn, not absolute /var... but relative var/....
    cd var/www/makina/$pool
    ln -s ../../../../www/ www
{% endhighlight %}

Yes, **that's ugly**, but at least we can now have a working php-fpm pool which is chrooted in `/var/www/makina/mydrupal`.  
Wait for **mod_proxy_fcgi** or avoid using chroot in php-fpm if you do not want that.

The final tree is:

<pre>
/ ==> [/ for everyone except the chrooted php-fpm]
  \-/var/
    \-www/
      \-makina/
        \-mydrupal/ [base of the chroot for php-fpm (/ for him)
          \-etc/
          \-doc/
          \-www/ ===> [A], DocumentRoot, here is Drupal
          \-var/
            \-tmp/
            \-log
            \-www/ ==> empty
              \-makina/ ==> empty
                \-mydrupal/ ==> empty
                  \-www/ ===> symbolic link to [A]
</pre>

**Warning**: see update at the end of article, there is maybe one way of not doing that

###Application VirtualHost###

Now we are going to create our Apache Virtualhost and our php-fpm project.  
You may need to tests things while creating all theses things. So I'll give you a few commands that could help you

####testing apache configuration:####

{% highlight bash %}
  #loading apache env variables (see the dot-space)
  . /etc/apache2/envvars
  # test apache configuration
  apache2 -t
  # list apache virtualhosts
  apache2 -S
  # list apache modules
  apache2 -M
  # restarting php-fpm (yes, not done via apache restart)
  /etc/init.php5-fpm restart
{% endhighlight %}

We need to creat the Apache VirtualHost for our current project.  
We'll put the source in our project directory `etc/` and link it to the main apache virtualhosts repository.  
But you could edit it directly in `/etc/apache2/sites-available` if you want
(I'm in fact even storing the pool configuration here and linking it to `/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d`).

{% highlight bash %}
    touch /var/www/makina/mydrupal/etc/apache.conf
    ln -s /var/www/makina/mydrupal/etc/apache.conf /etc/apache2/site-available/101-mydrupal
    a2ensite 101-mydrupal
{% endhighlight %}

And now we need to write some content inside this `/var/www/makina/mydrupal/etc/apache.conf`.  
And in this Virtualhost we'll need to connect the PHP scripts to the php-fpm.
So I'll first gives you a complete VirtualHost and then we will detail how the php-fpm is managed inside.

{% highlight apache %}
<virtualHost *:80>

{% endhighlight %}

This VirtualHost contains some parts of the [previous article]({% post_url 2011-09-01-better_rewrite_rules_for_drupal %})
(like extended rewrite rules) but the main php-fpm things are:

 * an **handler php5-fcgi** for all `.php` files
 * an **action** catching this php5-fcgi telling apache to push that to a file **/fcgi-bin/php5.external** (keep cool, all theses things are virtual)
 * an **alias** catching this **/fcgi-bin/php5.external** and pushing it to the url **/php5.external**
 * a **Location** directive, handling only the **/php5.external** url, where we enforce the fact this url cannot be accessed directly, only via internal redirects (so from all the previous points here)
 * The connection of a **virtual file name php.external** to a **fastcgi service**, via a given socket. It's the line containing `FastCgiExternalServer`.

So that's all. Any HTTP request for something not static or rejected ends to Drupal's index.php,
which is then redirected internally to the virtual external file (php.external),
where it's connected to a socket mydrupal.sock which is relative to the `FastCgiIpcDir` we defined previously,
so it's `/var/www/makina/mydrupal/var/fcgi/mydrupal.sock`.   
This is the socket used for the communication channel between php-fpm and Apache.  
In the php-fpm pool configuration we defined this same socket with the listen command
(without prefix: `/var/www/makina/mydrupal/var/fcgi/mydrupal.sock` and with the chroot and prefix: `listen = var/fcgi/mydrupal.sock`).

###File access rights###
We need to apply some rights for the apache user.  
Basically the www-user needs **read access** to the Web Document Root and some **write** rights on the `sites/default/files` directory.

Here is a list of commands that should do the trick, could certainly be done in other ways (like more restrictive, I'll update it one day).

{% highlight bash %}
 echo "apply ownership"
 chown -R root:www-data /var/www/makina/mydrupal/*
 echo "default directories read rights"
 find /var/www/makina/mydrupal/www \( -type d -wholename "/var/www/makina/mydrupal/www/sites/default/files" -prune \) -o -type d -exec chmod 2750 {} \;
 echo "default files read rights"
 find /var/www/makina/mydrupal/www  \( -type f -wholename "/var/www/makina/mydrupal/www/sites/default/files" -prune \) -o -type f -exec chmod 0640 {} \;
 echo "directories write rights"
 find /var/www/makina/mydrupal/www/sites/default/files -type d -exec chmod 2770 {} \;
 echo "files write rights"
 find /var/www/makina/mydrupal/www/sites/default/files -type f -exec chmod 0660 {} \;
 chown root:www-data /var/www/makina/mydrupal/
 chown root:www-data /var/www/makina/mydrupal/var/fcgi
 chmod 2770 /var/www/makina/mydrupal/var/fcgi
 chown -R root:www-data /var/www/makina/mydrupal/var/tmp
 chmod 2770 /var/www/makina/mydrupal/var/tmp
{% endhighlight %}

###Starting & Stoping Apache & PHP###

Remember that php-fpm is not anymore linked to apache, so you'have an init script for php as well.

{% highlight bash %}
    /etc/init.d/php5-fpm [start|stop]
{% endhighlight %}

Exactly like mysql or apache2. You may check that the /etc/rc*/ files are there for the startup scripts

{% highlight bash %}
    ls -alh /etc/rc*.d/???php5-fpm
{% endhighlight %}
    
##Final steps, Database & Settings##

No surprises here, I'm quite sure you know how to perform all theses steps. But that's a step by step, so here are the last ones

Well, in fact you may have one surprise in the settings.php

{% highlight bash %}
    apt-get install mysql-server-5.1
{% endhighlight %}

Create database and user for application (alter the default passwords and users of course):

{% highlight sql %}
    mysql -u root -p
    > CREATE DATABASE mydrupal CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
    > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mydrupal.* TO mydrupaluser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'mydrupaluserpassord';
    > FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
{% endhighlight %}

Alter application conf to use real database user and paths. For drupal it's usually in `[project root]/www/sites/default/settings.php`.

Import the project dump if it's already available, or get to the `http://mydrupal.example.com/install.php` url (or use `drush install`).

{% highlight bash %}
   mysql -u mydrupaluser --password="mydrupaluserpassord" --character-set=utf8 mydrupal < /var/www/makina/mydrupal/sql/dump.sql
{% endhighlight %}

###Where's my surprise in the settings.php?###

Yes, if you defined previously the temporary directory in the settings file, which is a very good place to define it
(I'm not a very good fan of configuration stored in database), you may have something like:

{% highlight php %}
    $conf['file_directory_temp'] = '/var/www/makina/mydrupal/var/tmp';
{% endhighlight %}

Or even

{% highlight php %}
    $conf['file_directory_temp'] = '/tmp';
{% endhighlight %}

But now we're in a chroot, the new path is:

{% highlight php %}
    $conf['file_directory_temp'] = '/var/tmp';
{% endhighlight %}
    
And the same thing apply for any filesystem related setting in drupal (but you should not have a lot of them).


##Update. Avoid chroot symlink hack with doc_root php setting?##

A very nice backtrack.

 * [http://auntitled.blogspot.com/2011/10/chroot-php-fpm-and-apache.html](http://auntitled.blogspot.com/2011/10/chroot-php-fpm-and-apache.html)
 
The autor finally found a useful usage of php [doc_root](http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.doc-root) setting and explain it could help avoiding the fake document root symnlink inside the chroot.
